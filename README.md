# Memory Card/Matching Game
I made this game for a final project in school.

A board will be displayed with numbered squares representing cards.\
You can input numbers to “flip over cards” revealing an animal emoji on the other side.\
The goal is to find more matches than the computer opponent.

# Playing the Game.
This game is meant to be played in a terminal/console that supports unicode printing. It should in Windows, Linux, and OS X environments.

It can be run with:
```
python main.py
```
Or:
```
python3 main.py
```

If the emojis are not displaying properly:

Then the terminal you are using does not support Unicode printing.
